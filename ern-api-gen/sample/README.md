## Sample schema and output

This folder contains a sample schema as well as the produced output.  

The sample schema, [apigen.schema](apigen.schema) represent an imaginary weather API.  
It contains all the generation constructs type currently supported by the api generator.

The output resulting from the generation can be found in the [react-native-weather-api-generated](/react-native-weather-api-generated) folder.

If you make changes to the api generator, please make sure to update the schema accordingly (if you update the schema parser to add new constructs or modify existing one) as well as the output folder by regenerating the api.

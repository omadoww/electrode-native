ERN Cauldron API
===

Cauldron is a version management server to keep an app in sync across IOS, Android and JavaScript world. It helps to keep track of the matrix of which TLAâ€™s have what binary parts installed. 


Cauldron allows to easily group miniapps together, to (automatically) determine the correct (or incorrect) versions of native dependencies. Since cauldron keeps track of the versions of the apps/miniapps that is published the OTA relies on cauldron to identify if an OTA update can be pushed (compatibility check) to the live apps. 


Cauldron API uses git as a backend.  If no repository is given it only does local changes. 

Cauldron stores information in a single JSON document which will be auto generated and committed to the repo when you use cauldron cli. 

Applications can choose to have one cauldron repositiry per native app or organization since the API can store one or more native apps and it's dependencies in it's JSON file.

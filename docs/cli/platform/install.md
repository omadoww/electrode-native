**Installs a platform version**

### Command

#### `ern platform install <version>`

Installs the given platform `version` locally, without switching to it.  
Once installed, it is then possible to switch to this version through `ern platform use` command. If you need to immediately switch to this version upon installation, you should rather directly use `ern platform use` command which will take care of installing the version if needed, before switching to it.

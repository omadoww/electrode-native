**Uninstalls a platform version**

### Command

#### `ern platform uninstall <version>`

This will uninstall a given platform version.  
Please note that this command will fail if you try to uninstall the currently activated platform version. If that is what you're trying to do, you'll need to first switch to a different version using `ern platform use` command.

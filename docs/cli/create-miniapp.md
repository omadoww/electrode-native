**Creates a  new `MiniApp`**

This command is the `ern` equivalent of `react-native init` command. Under the hood, it actually calls this `react native` command for you.  

The generated `MiniApp` is a starter `hello world MiniApp` that you can either launch standalone on `iOS` or `Android` in our `Runner` using `ern run-ios` and `ern run-android` commands.  

If you already used `react native`, you'll notice that the generated JS `react native` MiniApp is exactly the same `react native` starter app as the one provided by `react native`. You should feel right at home. After all, a `MiniApp` is just a `react native` application, that just proves the point. One of the difference with `react native` is that we generate our own native project, which will use a locally generated `ern` container.

You might also notice that there is no `ios` or `android` directories generated by this command. We generate those lazily, when running `ern run-ios` or `ern run-android` commnand.

### Command

#### `ern create-miniapp <appName>`

This command will create a new `MiniApp` in a new directory named after the `MiniApp` one.  
For example if you run `ern create-miniapp MyAwesomeApp`, it will create a directory `MyAwesomeApp` containing the generated `MiniApp`.  

#### `ern create-miniapp <appName> --scope <scope>`

Use a specific npm scope for the `MiniApp` package. 

This will add the scope automatically in the `package.json` of the generated `MiniApp`.
For example, `ern create-miniapp MyAwesomeApp --scope MyCompany` will set the `name` field in `package.json` with `@MyCompany/MyAwesomeApp`.

#### `ern create-miniapp <appName> --platformVersion <version>`

Use a specific platform version, other than the currently activated one, to create the `MiniApp`.  

This should be rarely used, but can be useful in some scenarios. What this will do is use the templates and dependency versions bound to a given `ern` platform version to create the `MiniApp`.

### Caveats

You cannot use any special characters for your `MiniApp` name.  
Please also note that dashes (`-`) cannot be used.

### Remarks

This command is the `ern` equivalent of `react-native init`
